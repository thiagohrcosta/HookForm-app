# Sticker Album
This is a small project using React and ChakraUI with the objective of testing the implementation of the React Hook-Form library for form validation.

For that, a project was developed where the user can add some of his favorite soccer players with name, photo and overall. When trying to add empty fields or with information that is incompatible with each input, an error message will be shown to the user immediately.
